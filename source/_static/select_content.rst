This stage determines the rectangular region with "useful" or useable
content (shaded in color). Why do we need to define this area? Firstly
in order to determine the page size to the output. The content will be
added to the total margin area, and the outer limit of these margins
affects the size of the output file. Secondly so that the final images
don't show the line of fold or other debris from the edges. Strictly
speaking whether the debris falls in the margin in the output stage
depends on the mode. In most modes the margin is filled in white.

If areas are identified incorrectly, you can tweak individual pages
manually by setting the mouse pointer over the edge, clicking & dragging
as needed. Occasionally Scan Tailor may find non-existent content or
conversely not select content where it should. In this case, you can
manually create / delete a region by right-clicking on the image, and
select the appropriate menu item.
