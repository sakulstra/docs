-  To get a good result with Scan Tailor, and minimise errors in the
   automatic processing, follow these rules when scanning:

-  Don’t scan in black and white mode - use grayscale, or, if necessary,
   colour.

-  Don’t scan at any lower resolution than 300 DPI, typically scan at
   300 or 600 DPI.

-  Do not scan to JPEG – the format is lossy, and converting to other
   formats will not result in better quality. (Camera users will most
   likely need to use JPG mode but use the best resolution possible).

-  When scanning typically use TIFF format, but be careful as TIFF can
   be used for jpeg-compression algorithms.

-  If you need to compress the image then choose LZW - a lossless format

-  If unable to use TIFF then scan to PNG - it is guaranteed to use
   lossless compression algorithms, or, in extreme cases, to BMP (file
   size will be uncompressed and therefore enormous, and should
   preferably be converted into a format that uses lossless
   compression).

-  Avoid scanning mode "Document", and generally try to disable all
   options to improve the scans.
