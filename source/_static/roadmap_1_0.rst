The first main target should be a cleanup of existing code and issues,
so we can target a v1.0.0 branch(http://semver.org/)

Organising the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ☐ identify useful enhanced features
-  ☐ merge enhanced features into master
-  ☐ remove old/unused branches
-  ☐ cleaner file/folder organisation
-  ☐ document code(so we can generate
   `sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ or some other docu)
-  ☐ javadoc like file header comments(@copyright, @license)
-  ☐ write some tests

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ☐ document (new)features
-  ☐ write some contribution guide
-  ☐ define some standards (naming conventions, tests)

Miscellaneous(not important at all)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ☑ implement some ircbot(@sakulstra)
-  ☐ scrutinizer-ci(@sakulstra - c++ not yet supported)

Missing Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to identify which features in the enhanced, plus, featured, and
possibly qt5 branches are not in the main branch, and add each one as a
feature request on the github issue tracker.
