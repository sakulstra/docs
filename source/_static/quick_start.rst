1.  Open ScanTailor & select "new project" to begin with a new set of
    images.

2.  Browse to select the directory that contains the images you wish to
    process

3.  Select the images as required.

4.  ScanTailor will default to using the same directory appended with an
    "out" directory for processed images but you can select a different
    directory at this stage if you wish.

5.  At the next stage it's necessary to set the DPI level. Click on "all
    pages", set or use drop arrow in ‘custom’ to select the level. For
    accurate content selection use a lower setting (300 x 300). For
    digital camera images you may need to measure the physical
    dimensions of the area of which the picture was taken and then
    divide to get the DPI (dots or pixels per inch).

6.  Set the orientation of the first image, if necessary click "apply
    to" and select "all pages" to propagate that setting to the rest of
    the images.

7.  Click to "split pages". If the image is of two pages of a book for
    instance ScanTailor will attempt to split the image into the two
    pages. Click on the > arrow to have ScanTailor batch process split
    for the remainder of the images. Splits can be set using the page
    layout section.

8.  In all cases individual pages can be inspected in the thumbnails to
    the right of the main page, clicking on a thumbnail will load that
    page to the main area and allow for adjustment of various
    parameters.

9.  Select "deskew" if it’s needed and ScanTailor will attempt to
    straighten up text and images based on the edges of the text/image.
    Once again use the > arrow to batch process as needed and use the
    thumbnails to quickly check each page.

10. Click on "select content" and batch process (> right arrow). Check
    thumbnails and adjust by selecting that thumbnail and altering main
    page as needed (click and drag edges of the content box). If no
    content is selected a content box may be manually entered by
    selecting that image and right-click in the main window, add content
    box and adjust as needed. Likewise one may remove a content box from
    a page by right-click and delete.

11. Then move to "page layout" and adjust the various parameters
    according to your requirements. ScanTailor defaults work well for
    most cases.

12. Finally click on "output" and select the type of image output
    desired. Black and white will produce a clean output image for
    simple text and line drawings. If some text appears to be "missing"
    try adjusting the line thickness to see if it appears (increase).
    Once set this may be applied to all pages and run through the batch
    process. Alternatively for images with photographs etc one may
    select "mixed" or even colour/grayscale. In all cases it’s wise to
    check the thumbs after processing particularly in black & white or
    mixed mode to ensure that all the required content is included.

13. Files will be saved as tiff's in the selected directory and may be
    further manipulated or used as required from there.
