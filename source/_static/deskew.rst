At this stage one may determine the angle which the page needs to be
turned for the text to be properly horizontal. Since compensation is a
simple rotation such distortions as keystone or curling can not be
corrected at this stage. The rotation angle is determined automatically,
but you can also set it manually.

Here is the working area in this mode:

Images can be rotated by dragging the round handles at the edges.

Here's what a panel of options looks like:

You can also explicitly specify the rotation angle in degrees. Positive
angles will rotate the image clockwise, negative counter-clockwise. For
fine adjustment of the angle it may be convenient to click the mouse on
the text portion of the input field corner, then move the mouse wheel to
fix it.
